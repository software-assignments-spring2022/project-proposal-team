### Motor Meals

Motor Meals is an app to help users locate, rate, and view ratings of food trucks/carts in their locality.

## What & Why?

Have you ever wanted a quick and cheap meal without having to go through the hassle of spending too much effort cooking or too much money on ordering takeout/delivery from a restaurant? Or perhaps you've had cravings for a particular street-style dish but are unsure about the quality of food or even where to find it? Motor Meals addresses all those problems by providing users with an app where they can view or update the latest location of food carts/trucks and ice cream vans, rate them, and view other people's ratings and reviews. 

## For Whom?

This app is designed for individuals on a budget such as students, or those with a busy schedule, or those who enjoy food carts and ice cream vans but are unsure of where to find them or which ones are the best in the locality. Since the app will feature a ratings/review feature, it will allow users to gauge the popularity of these various mobile food establishments as well.  

## How?

The app will feature a map similar to Google Maps as the homepage with small icon pop-ups indicating the most recent sightings of food trucks alongside an accurate description of when and where these trucks were spotted by other users. Moreover, these icons can also feature short descriptions of the cuisine or type of food available at that particular establishment.

It will also allows users to post location updates of food trucks/vans as well as rate and review them. Users will also have the capability of viewing ratings and reviews of other users as well as an overall rating calculated based on the total user ratings. The review system will also allow people to post pictures/text alongside their ratings, allowing users to get recommendations based on the reviews.

The app will also provide users with a 'filters' feature to allow them to modify their search based on user ratings, duration of updates, or type of food/cuisines available.

## Scope

Considering the limited features to be implemented currently, the app could require a team of 4-5 people working on it for a semester. There would be a need to develop a review/rating systems integrated with functionality for images and texts as well as the capability to host real time user updates, along with other tasks.

Since the app depends heavily on user interactivity, it could be further expanded to include more features as well, such as an online pickup ordering system.
